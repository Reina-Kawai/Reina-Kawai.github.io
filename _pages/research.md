[Heterogeneous Asset Returns and Monetary Policy Redistribution](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/)
> The paper shows that the elasticity of aggregate consumption from a one percent de-
cline in the real interest rate is significantly underestimated in the absence of returns
heterogeneity through the redistribution channel in the short run. My mechanism op-
erates via the differential impact of a monetary policy shock for equity & housing with
its consequent implications for heterogeneous MPCs across the wealth distribution.
Greater the gap between returns across assets, larger is the aggregate consumption
response. I develop a flexible model free sufficient statistics approach that can handle
the conditional impact of monetary policy. Relative to Auclert (2019), aggregate con-
sumption in general equilibrium is 15% higher with a 43% share of redistribution. It
is 74% higher in comparison to a RANK model with separate returns to housing and
equity. Second, direct effects rise by nearly 63% and strengthens on shortening asset
maturities. Third, consumption declines 12% less under contractionary policy. The
model predicts consumption to increase by 30% (53%) if all mortgages were ARMs
with baseline (quarterly) maturity in 2019. In 2007, a lower wealth inequality would
predict an even larger response. Household portfolio heterogeneity affects overall mon-
etary transmission more than previously estimated, even for the short run.

[Choice of Refinancing & Hand-to-mouth Status](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/)
> What does the choice of refinancing reveal about the Hand-to-mouth (HtM) status of
households? Preliminary empirical analysis from the SCF corroborates the interlink-
age between household debt & HtM status. Further evidence from refinance approvals
indicate strong demand for home equity extraction in periods of high unemployment
often aided by higher house prices. Following Kaplan, Violante and Weidner (2014), I
motivate their measurement by setting up a 3 period partial equilibrium model with
heterogeneous preferences to investigate the importance of considering mortgages dis-
tinctly from other illiquid assets in the determination of HtM status. Better estimates
of the same is imperative for understanding the transmission and redistributive effects
of monetary policy & fiscal transfers. Simple qualitative experiments in a calibrated
model strongly match the current trends in house prices, unemployment and mortgage
refinancing.

<!--
> External sector surveillance and stabilization are core missions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1992, the IMF approved over 600 crisis country loan programs, conditional on reforms and performance targets that are contingent on IMF crisis assessments and recovery forecasts. The literature evaluating IMF crisis forecasts has primarily focused on GDP, inflation, and fiscal budgets, but IMF programs often originate with balance of payments crises. Our evaluation of IMF imports/exports/exchange rates in crisis countries reveals a surprising dichotomy: import forecasts are largely efficient and unbiased, while exports and exchange rate forecasts exhibit substantial biases and inefficiencies. We show forecast errors in the full sample are driven by deeply flawed IMF forecasts for LICs in crisis. Fixed exchange rate LICs (predominantly African franc zone countries) receive systematically inefficient import forecasts. Exchange rate forecasts for LICs with flexible exchange rates are so inefficient, they cannot outperform a naive random walk, and over 30 percent of the forecasts cannot match the exchange rate’s directional movement during the first year of the recovery. Examining the sources of biases and inefficiencies, we highlight effects of conditionality and geopolitics that were not fully accounted for in IMF forecasts, specifically those relating to arrears (domestic and foreign), fiscal finance (balance and credit limits), policy reforms (trade and government), (civil) wars, and elections.-->

[Public Debt and Real GDP: Revisiting the Impact](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/04/29/Public-Debt-and-Real-GDP-Revisiting-the-Impact-517449)
(with Constance de Soyres and Mengxue Wang)<br/>
**_IMF WP Number: 2022/076_**
> This paper provides new empirical evidence of the impact of an unanticipated change in public debt on real GDP. Using public debt forecast errors, we identify exogenous changes in public debt to assess the impact of a change in the debt to GDP ratio on real GDP. By analyzing data on gross public debt for 178 countries over 1995-2020, we find that the impact of an unanticipated increase in public debt on the real GDP level is generally negative and varies depending on other fundamental characteristics. Specifically, an unanticipated increase in the public debt to GDP ratio hurts real GDP level for countries that have (i) a high initial debt level or (ii) a rising debt trajectory over the five preceding years. On the contrary, an unanticipated increase in public debt boosts real GDP for countries that have (iii) a low-income level or (iv) completed the HIPC debt relief initiative. -->
