[Heterogeneous Asset Returns and Monetary Policy Redistribution](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/Heterogeneous_Asset_Returns_and_Monetary_Policy_Redistribution.pdf)
> My research explores the role of wealth inequality in the transmission of monetary policy to consumption in the short run. Specifically, I quantify the general equilibrium
effect on aggregate consumption of automatic wealth transfers caused by a change in the federal funds rate in an economy where households are heterogeneous in their marginal propensities to consume out of income. I make three main contributions. First, I provide empirical evidence for the differential effects of monetary policy on housing and stock markets and how these transmit to household balance sheets relative to liquid assets. Second, I show how unrealized wealth changes affect consumption using a sufficient statistics framework to robustly estimate aggregate consumption from survey data. Specifically, a 1% decrease in the federal funds rate increases consumption by 1.63% in general equilibrium. It is 15% higher relative to homogeneous asset returns & 74% lower in the absence of MPC heterogeneity. Third, I document significant asymmetric effects with aggregate consumption declining by only 1.02% on raising rates by 1% suggesting soft landings are harder to achieve. Finally, I also demonstrate how borrowing constraints interact with returns heterogeneity by housing tenure and age to provide more precise measures of exposures across groups of agents to identify winners and losers from changes in monetary policy. My research helps quantify the aggregate effect of this redistribution with corresponding increases of 3.02% and 1.43% for outright homeowners and mortgage holders. Similarly, middle aged people have an elasticity of 1.57 relative to 1.29 for the young.

[Choice of Refinancing & Hand-to-mouth Status](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/Choice_of_Refinancing_and_Hand_to_mouth_Status.pdf)
> What does the choice of refinancing reveal about the Hand-to-mouth (HtM) status of households? Preliminary empirical analysis from the SCF corroborates the interlinkage between household debt & HtM status. Further evidence from refinance approvals indicate strong demand for home equity extraction in periods of high unemployment often aided by higher house prices. Following Kaplan, Violante and Weidner (2014), I motivate their measurement by setting up a 3 period partial equilibrium model with heterogeneous preferences to investigate the importance of considering mortgages distinctly from other illiquid assets in the determination of HtM status. Better estimates of the same is imperative for understanding the transmission and redistributive effects of monetary policy & fiscal transfers. Simple qualitative experiments in a calibrated model strongly match the current trends in house prices, unemployment and mortgage refinancing.

> External sector surveillance and stabilization are core missions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1992, the IMF approved over 600 crisis country loan programs, conditional on reforms and performance targets that are contingent on IMF crisis assessments and recovery forecasts. The literature evaluating IMF crisis forecasts has primarily focused on GDP, inflation, and fiscal budgets, but IMF programs often originate with balance of payments crises. Our evaluation of IMF imports/exports/exchange rates in crisis countries reveals a surprising dichotomy: import forecasts are largely efficient and unbiased, while exports and exchange rate forecasts exhibit substantial biases and inefficiencies. We show forecast errors in the full sample are driven by deeply flawed IMF forecasts for LICs in crisis. Fixed exchange rate LICs (predominantly African franc zone countries) receive systematically inefficient import forecasts. Exchange rate forecasts for LICs with flexible exchange rates are so inefficient, they cannot outperform a naive random walk, and over 30 percent of the forecasts cannot match the exchange rate’s directional movement during the first year of the recovery. Examining the sources of biases and inefficiencies, we highlight effects of conditionality and geopolitics that were not fully accounted for in IMF forecasts, specifically those relating to arrears (domestic and foreign), fiscal finance (balance and credit limits), policy reforms (trade and government), (civil) wars, and elections.-->

[Public Debt and Real GDP: Revisiting the Impact](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/04/29/Public-Debt-and-Real-GDP-Revisiting-the-Impact-517449)
(with Constance de Soyres and Mengxue Wang)<br/>
**_IMF WP Number: 2022/076_**
> This paper provides new empirical evidence of the impact of an unanticipated change in public debt on real GDP. Using public debt forecast errors, we identify exogenous changes in public debt to assess the impact of a change in the debt to GDP ratio on real GDP. By analyzing data on gross public debt for 178 countries over 1995-2020, we find that the impact of an unanticipated increase in public debt on the real GDP level is generally negative and varies depending on other fundamental characteristics. Specifically, an unanticipated increase in the public debt to GDP ratio hurts real GDP level for countries that have (i) a high initial debt level or (ii) a rising debt trajectory over the five preceding years. On the contrary, an unanticipated increase in public debt boosts real GDP for countries that have (iii) a low-income level or (iv) completed the HIPC debt relief initiative. -->
