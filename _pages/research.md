An Assessment of 28 Years of Trade Forecasts: For 602 IMF Programs Countries<!--(https://econreinakawai.github.io/files/MonicaGR_JMP.pdf) [[slides](https://econreinakawai.github.io/files/IMF Nowcasts_slides.pdf)]-->
(with Theo Eicher)
> External sector surveillance and stabilization are core missions of the International Monetary Fund. Since 1992, the IMF approved over 600 crises countries’ loan programs that required reforms and performance targets. IMF programs forecast recovery trajectories that predicate program design. A voluminous literature analyzes IMF crises forecasts but focuses only on GDP/Inflation forecasts in small subsamples. IMF programs originate, however, mostly with balance of payments crises, hence we undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the IMF’s import/export/exchange rate forecasts for program countries. Result reveals a surprising dichotomy in the accuracy of IMF external sector forecasts. Import growth is efficiently and unbiasedly forecast, but export growth and exchange rate depreciations exhibit profound biases and inconsistencies that project unrealistic export and exchange rate targets for crisis countries. Results are largely independent of countries’ income levels or forecast horizons, but not of exchange rate regimes. Forecasts under fixed exchange rate regimes are remarkably inefficient for all external sector forecasts.

The Macroeconomic Effects of Debt on Real GDP Growth: Revisiting the Impact<!--(https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/NOR_MaPP.pdf)-->
(with Constance de Soyres and Mengxue Wang)
> Impact of public debt on real GDP growth is one of the long-standing issues intensely debated among macroeconomists. It is central to the IMF’s core assessments for borrowing countries’ capacity to repay and debt sustainability. This paper uses forecast errors to determine unanticipated changes in public debt. By analyzing 178 countries' data on gross public debt from 1995-2020 and 142 countries' data on public external debt from 1990-2020, we find that impact of public debt shocks to real GDP growth depends on other fundamental characteristics. We find some evidence with the response of Real GDP to gross public debt being more positive for: (i)Low-income countries; (ii)Initial low debt level of low-income countries; (iii) Low-income countries with Less risk of Civil War; (iv)Post GFC and (v) Positive trajectory. Interestingly, the results prove to be largely independent of the gross external debt shock despite it being a subset of gross public debt.
