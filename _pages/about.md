Welcome! 
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Washington.
I am an applied macroeconomist with interests primarily lie in the field of applied econometrics, macroeconomics, forecasting, and growth. My passion is to develop policy implications through a theory-based empirical approach. 

I am on the job market during the 2022-2023 academic year and am available for interviews.
