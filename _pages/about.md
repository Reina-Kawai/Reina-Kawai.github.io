Welcome! 
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu/).

I am an applied macroeconomist with a research portfolio comprised of papers in international macroeconomics, macro-finance, and applied econometrics. And my passion is to develop theory-based policy implications through empirical work. My job market paper investigates the accuracy of IMF nowcasts in times of crises. This study provides guidance on how to further improve IMF nowcasts efficiency to better design and assess the loan programs, and ultimately help countries restore economic growth. The second paper in my dissertation empirically examines the role of macroprudential policy in addressing the effects of external shocks on financial stability. Prior to pursuing Ph.D., I served as a research assitant for two years at the University of Minnesota and University of Hawaii (Professor Inessa Love), primarily researching growth determinants in the emerging market economies.

I am on the 2021â€“2022 job market and am available for interviews during and after the EEA and AEA/ASSA meetings.
