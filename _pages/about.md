Welcome! 
======
I am an Economist at the World Bank. I recently received my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am an applied macroeconomist with interests primarily in the fields of applied macroeconomics, applied econometrics, forecasting, and growth. My passion is to develop policy implications through a theory-based empirical approach.
