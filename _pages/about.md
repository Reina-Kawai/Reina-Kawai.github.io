Welcome! 
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Washington.
I am a computational macroeconomist with interests in wealth inequality, housing and heterogenous agent DSGEs, monetary policy and applied econometrics. My research aims to develop structural models motivated by empirics with practical implications for monetary & fiscal policy.
